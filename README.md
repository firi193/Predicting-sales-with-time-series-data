# Predicting-sales-with-time-series-data

The main challenge faced by any retail store is predicting in advance the sales and inventory required at each store to avoid over-stocking and under-stocking. 
This helps the business to provide the best customer experience and avoid getting into losses, thus ensuring the store is sustainable for operation.  
Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality.

The following was performed in this project:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Cleaning
- Testing for seasonality and trend factor
- Testing stationarity 
- Predictive modelling
